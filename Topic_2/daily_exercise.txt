I'd use an R script if I needed to do statistical analysis, make plots, or require complex objects
for other analyses.

Piping keeps the data inputs and outputs in-memory, as opposed to writing to a file which requires
reading from disk. Reading from disk is is more "expensive" (takes longer time), as the computer
needs to go to the disk, read that information, and then return it. This all must happen before
the next program is run in the pipeline, which slows it down compared to keeping things in memory.
