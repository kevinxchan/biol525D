1.

The reads aren't in any particular order, as no sorting has been done yet.

2.

This is the extended CIGAR string. In our data, the majority have "100M", or 100 matches. The string
"1S93M6S" would mean the first base is soft-clipped, followed by 93 matches, then the last six
bases are soft clipped.

3.

i. the read could be mapped to many different places because it is part of a repetitive region
ii. the read is of low quality
iii.

1. 

Generally yes, unless the mapping quality is poor or if the reads map erroneously. If the reads
map to repetitive regions, or there are many repeats in the genome, then the higher mapping rate
may not reflect an accurate alignment.

2. 

There are multiple settings which can be used to changed the penalties for gaps, extensions, mismatches,
clipping, and unpaired reads (-B, -O, -E, -L, -U). -c INT will also discard a MEM if it occurs more than
INT time in the genome. 

3. 

The speed of the aligner, as this could determine which aligner is best with the size of the data.
The percentage of mapped reads, as this could determine which aligner to use depending on how divergent
the reference genome is.
