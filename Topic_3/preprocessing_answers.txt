There are differences in length, base quality distribution, tag sequences, and number of duplicates.
GBS requires restriction sites, thus all sequences would have the same bases at the first 5 positions.

I would choose to quality trim both ends of the reads, as the quality score graph shows a general decrease 
towards the right end of the read, and at the left end. Although one could use the average quality,
it would be better to explicitly target the ends where quality is known to be lower. In the case of 
RNA, it would also be beneficial to filter out low complexity regions (DUST/entropy threshold),
as this would remove polyA tails.

Minimum length can also be used depending on how stringent the data cleaning should be.
